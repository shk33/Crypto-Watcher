# Crypto Chart Watcher

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Imagine you're on a team with a more junior developer who has a cool idea for a product that allows you to track cryptocurrencies and see their price movements. He's got a proof of concept but needs help cleaning it up.

## Running the App

Runs the app in the development mode using `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
